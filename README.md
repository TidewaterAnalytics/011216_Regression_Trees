### Regression Trees

Data and code for the Tuesday, 12 January Meetup.

The students.csv code and associasted students.R code are used in the first part of the presentation to introduce the audience to the fundamental concept behind building a regression tree: reducing the overall residual sum of squares (RSS) by partitioning the data.

The hitters.csv code and associated hitters.R code are used to illustrate building a regression tree and use of the R `tree` package.
